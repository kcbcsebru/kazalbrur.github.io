My name is Kazal Chandra Barman, I'm currently studying at final year towards my BSC Engineering degree in Computer Science at the Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur, Bangladesh. What do I do? I code. I started my programming journey from a years ago with my GF (HP Pavilion G4 ), And I am Still On the Way to Learning .  

I have a strong theoretical background in Computer Science, so Java and C are my weapons of choice for solving problems. Whether it's high level or low level I love getting my hands dirty and making things work, especially if it involves learning new concepts. One of my passions is Human Computer Interaction. Now I am studying on Deep Learning (Machine Learning) With My honorable Teacher Mr. Mizanur Rohoman PHD at our <a href=" Semanticslab.net">Semanticslab.net</a>
